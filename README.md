This repository contains, or will contain, various fragments of code of various algorithms,
data structures, and protocol implementations. These will mostly be written in C++, C, and
Java, and some small fragments will probably be written in assembly (Intel and ARM).

There are also (or will be) ethical hacking challenge write-ups, centered mostly on
exploiting vulnerable binaries (stack smashing, return-oriented-programming, ret2dl...
In other words, arc-injection techniques for exploitable binaries).
